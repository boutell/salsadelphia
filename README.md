# salsadelphia

salsadelphia is a directory of recurring events in the Philadelphia
salsa dancing community. It is also an open source example of a
nodejs-based web application with Facebook authentication.

## Getting it running

Note `local-example.js`. You'll need to create a `data` subdirectory and
copy `local-example.js` to `data/local.js`, then add your own Facebook
application settings and your account's Facebook ID as the administrator.
